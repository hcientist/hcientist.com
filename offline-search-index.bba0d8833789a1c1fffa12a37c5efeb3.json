[{"body":"Student Hours (a.k.a. ‚ÄúOffice Hours‚Äù): No appointment is needed for my regularly scheduled office hours if you are attending in person. If you need to attend via zoom, please try to confirm that with me by email so I know to sign on.\nPlease feel welcome and encouraged to stop by. Office Hours are a great time to followup on questions you have that you may not have had time to discuss with me and your classmates during class time. It's also just a nice time for us to get to know each other a little better in a smaller group setting. If you need to speak with me privately, office hours can also be a good time, just let me know as we begin so I understand it's not a group topic. To learn more about how office hours work, check out the JMU CS Wiki.\nSpring 2024 in King 212 (here's a link to subscribe to my office hours calendar) Monday-Friday 2:00PM-3:00PM Office Hours Zoom (with confirmed appointment) ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Student Hours (a.k.a. ‚ÄúOffice Hours‚Äù): No appointment is needed for my ‚Ä¶","ref":"/contact/","tags":"","title":"Contact"},{"body":"Use anchor tags if you‚Äôre making a hyperlink Assistive Tech Developers are just the best. In the hellscape that is the web, they manage to do amazing things. Let‚Äôs help a pal out and follow web standards and accessibility guidelines whenever possible.\nScenarios There are 2 scenarios that I‚Äôm thinking of:\nwebdev wants to perform an action when the user clicks, uses an anchor tag without an href (which is invalid) and listens for the click event. This one seems to be covered all over the web. I‚Äôm a North Carolinian‚Ä¶ sort of, so I‚Äôll just link NC State on this one. webdev has code that mostly does a bunch of other things great, doesn‚Äôt want to break a bunch of old code and style, but does want to be able to link out to another page, so they apply a click handler that updates the window.location turning some non-anchor element into a link. Link-ifying the SIGCSE 2024 web program The SIGCSE 2024 web program has a bunch of these. I‚Äôm fearful of falling for the fallacy of Chesterson‚Äôs Fence or whatever, so I‚Äôll mention it to the organizers (do you think I hit up the Universal Design Chairs or the Web and Data Chairs? WHY NOT BOTH?! üòÜ).

Prof. CS@JMU I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at James Madison University in the beautiful Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, USA. I primarily teach Introduction to Programming (CS 149), Advanced Programming (CS 159, anticipated), Designing Interactive Systems (CS 480 and CS 447), and Front-End Web Development (CS 347). My teaching interests include recruiting students from diverse backgrounds (with respect to academic interests, but especially with respect to demographics) and finding parts of the design and computing fields that serve them in following their passions.\nMy research interests fall under the enormous umbrella of Human Computer Interaction. More specifically I am interested in studying (and designing for) people‚Äôs interpersonal interactions and relationships, especially when their interaction is mediated by technology. I am interested in designing novel technological support for the subtle and delicate [sociality]‚Äù of human relationships. Of course being primarily interested in teaching, I often cross the streams and design and study these research interests in the context of education and the classroom.\nGoldydocs provides a single web UI providing visibility into porridge temperature, chair size, and bed softness metrics!
