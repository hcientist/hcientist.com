## Beginning (again) with the Mental Inventory

From Part 1 - The Preparation: Decluttering Your Mind (pg. 34).

This was difficult for me to do in 1 sitting. I also don't feel like it's necessarily done?

Where in this book is the next step??

Nathan's right that it feels rather self-helpy, doesn't mean it's bad tho? Also bc I abbreviated it once to "BuJo" and i guess that sounds almost like (el) brujo, so we enjoy calling it that now.
