I got it for Christmas for myself over a year ago... 

Pressure? John says 40 psi in rear and 38 in front based on like my bike, tires, and weight.

There's also [this pdf that has ranges](https://s7d4.scene7.com/is/content/TrekBicycleProducts/Asset%20Library/documents/pdf/BT20_Tire_Pressures.pdf)

maybe [this is my manual](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0603/4027/3331/files/M2-Manual.pdf)? 

loosen the thing to get the bike on there

there's a light on the power adapter, but that's not the status light the manual is talking about

it was way too hard, it should keep spinning once I stop pedaling

loosened it, seems much better, actually possible to complete calibration ðŸ˜†

app is sideways (on iphone)

can't see friend request?
