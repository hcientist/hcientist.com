<h2 id="office-hours">Student Hours (a.k.a. “Office Hours”):</h2>
<p>No appointment is needed for my regularly scheduled office hours if you are attending in person. If you need to attend via zoom, please try to confirm that with me by email so I know to sign on.</p>
<p>Please feel welcome and encouraged to stop by. Office Hours are a great time to followup on questions you have that you may not have had time to discuss with me and your classmates during class time. It's also just a nice time for us to get to know each other a little better in a smaller group setting. If you need to speak with me privately, office hours can also be a good time, just let me know as we begin so I understand it's not a group topic.
