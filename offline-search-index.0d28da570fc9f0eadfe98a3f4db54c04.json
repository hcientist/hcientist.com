[{"body":"Student Hours (a.k.a. “Office Hours”): No appointment is needed for my regularly scheduled office hours if you are attending in person. If you need to attend via zoom, please try to confirm that with me by email so I know to sign on.\nPlease feel welcome and encouraged to stop by. Office Hours are a great time to followup on questions you have that you may not have had time to discuss with me and your classmates during class time. It's also just a nice time for us to get to know each other a little better in a smaller group setting. If you need to speak with me privately, office hours can also be a good time, just let me know as we begin so I understand it's not a group topic. To learn more about how office hours work, check out the JMU CS Wiki.\nFall 2023 in King 212 (here's a link to subscribe to my office hours calendar) Tuesdays and Fridays: 9:30 - 11:30 Mondays and Fridays: 3:00 - 4:00 Office Hours Zoom (with appointment) ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Student Hours (a.k.a. “Office Hours”): No appointment is needed for my …","ref":"/contact/","tags":"","title":"Contact"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/blog/news/","tags":"","title":"News About Docsy"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/blog/releases/","tags":"","title":"New Releases"},{"body":"This is a typical blog post that includes images.\nThe front matter specifies the date of the blog post, its title, a short description that will be displayed on the blog landing page, and its author.\nIncluding images Here’s an image (featured-sunset-get.png) that includes a byline and a caption.\nFetch and scale an image in the upcoming Hugo 0.43.

Prof. CS@JMU I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at James Madison University in the beautiful Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, USA. I primarily teach Introduction to Programming (CS 149), Advanced Programming (CS 159, anticipated), Designing Interactive Systems (CS 480 and CS 447), and Front-End Web Development (CS 347). My teaching interests include recruiting students from diverse backgrounds (with respect to academic interests, but especially with respect to demographics) and finding parts of the design and computing fields that serve them in following their passions.\nMy research interests fall under the enormous umbrella of Human Computer Interaction. More specifically I am interested in studying (and designing for) people’s interpersonal interactions and relationships, especially when their interaction is mediated by technology. I am interested in designing novel technological support for the subtle and delicate [sociality]” of human relationships. Of course being primarily interested in teaching, I often cross the streams and design and study these research interests in the context of education and the classroom.\nGoldydocs provides a single web UI providing visibility into porridge temperature, chair size, and bed softness metrics! You can even find out who’s been eating your porridge.\n(Sadly, Goldydocs isn’t a real project, but you can use this site as an example to create your own real websites with Docsy)\nNew chair metrics!
