[{"body":"Student Hours (a.k.a. “Office Hours”): No appointment is needed for my regularly scheduled office hours if you are attending in person. If you need to attend via zoom, please try to confirm that with me by email so I know to sign on.\nPlease feel welcome and encouraged to stop by. Office Hours are a great time to followup on questions you have that you may not have had time to discuss with me and your classmates during class time. It's also just a nice time for us to get to know each other a little better in a smaller group setting. If you need to speak with me privately, office hours can also be a good time, just let me know as we begin so I understand it's not a group topic. To learn more about how office hours work, check out the JMU CS Wiki.\nSpring 2024 in King 212 (here's a link to subscribe to my office hours calendar) Monday-Friday 2:00PM-3:00PM Office Hours Zoom (with confirmed appointment) ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Student Hours (a.k.a. “Office Hours”): No appointment is needed for my …","ref":"/contact/","tags":"","title":"Contact"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/tags/bujo/","tags":"","title":"bujo"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Set the thing up last night, here goes everything.","excerpt":"Set the thing up last night, here goes everything.","ref":"/blog/2024/01/10/day-1-with-the-bullet-journal/","tags":["bujo"],"title":"Day 1 with the Bullet Journal"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/tags/","tags":"","title":"Tags"},{"body":"Not sure I remember where the next action item after Mental Inventory is, but I’m going setup the journal next following the end of Part 2 - The System: Set up (pg.118).\n~2.5 hours, mostly flipping to pg 118 think I finished. didn’t aim to do a daily reflection this evening ","categories":"","description":"Not sure I remember where the next step is...","excerpt":"Not sure I remember where the next step is...","ref":"/blog/2024/01/09/setting-up-the-bullet-journal/","tags":["bujo"],"title":"Setting up the Bullet Journal"},{"body":"Beginning (again) with the Mental Inventory From Part 1 - The Preparation: Decluttering Your Mind (pg. 34).\nThis was difficult for me to do in 1 sitting.

Prof. CS@JMU I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at James Madison University in the beautiful Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, USA. I primarily teach Introduction to Programming (CS 149), Advanced Programming (CS 159, anticipated), Designing Interactive Systems (CS 480 and CS 447), and Front-End Web Development (CS 347). My teaching interests include recruiting students from diverse backgrounds (with respect to academic interests, but especially with respect to demographics) and finding parts of the design and computing fields that serve them in following their passions.\nMy research interests fall under the enormous umbrella of Human Computer Interaction. More specifically I am interested in studying (and designing for) people’s interpersonal interactions and relationships, especially when their interaction is mediated by technology. I am interested in designing novel technological support for the subtle and delicate [sociality]” of human relationships. Of course being primarily interested in teaching, I often cross the streams and design and study these research interests in the context of education and the classroom.\nGoldydocs provides a single web UI providing visibility into porridge temperature, chair size, and bed softness metrics!
